# phemex_trading_bot

Phemex tradingbot consists of two files. The first config.py contains api_key and api_secret, which are needed to work with the trading bot. You can receive it when creating api for the bot in the support/api management section at https://phemex.com/user-guides/api-overview. But before that don't forget to register on phemex exchange. The second file is the trading bot itself. I have added comments to it, so there is no problem with understanding all of the processes. Good luck!
